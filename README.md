# Graidant Llama

A small gradius-like game, built in an afternoon in 2012 to test out HTML5
canvas features. Shoot the space-alien-tomato things before they get you!

## Controls

* up/down/left/right arrows - Move the llama's ship
* space bar - Fire

## Score

Score is determined by how many space-alien-tomato thing you take out, how many
you let pass, and your accuracy.
